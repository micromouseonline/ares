class TrapezoidOld;

/***
 * The TrapezoidOld class manages speed as a function of time or distance. A profile
 * is trapezoidal in shape and consists of up to three phases.
 *
 *  - Acceleration : changing from the initial speed to the maximum speed
 *  - Coasting     : moving at the maximum speed
 *  - Braking      : changing to the final speed
 *
 * The names are only really relevant to a subset of all possible profiles since
 * the coasting section may not be possible if the acceleration is low or the
 * maximum speed is otherwise unreachable. Also, note that the initial speed may
 * be higher than the maximum speed so the first phase actually needs braking.
 *
 * Once started, the profile must be regularly updated from the system control
 * loop and this must be done before the motor control task since it uses the
 * current profile speed in its calculation.
 *
 * The robot has two instances of a Profile - one for forward motion and one
 * for rotation. These are completely independent but the combination of the
 * two allows the robot full freedom of motion within the constraints imposed
 * by the drive arrangement. That is, any combination of forward and rotary
 * motion is possible at all times.
 *
 * Although the units in the comments are shown as mm, the class is unit
 * agnostic and you can interpret the units as mm, cm, deg, bananas or anything
 * else. Just be consistent when using speed and acceleration.
